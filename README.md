# Support Voice Agent

Python LLM voice agent for customer support — see `CLAUDE.md` for how this project should be built (Claude Code reads this automatically), `PROJECT_PLAN.md` for the full ten-phase plan, and `PROGRESS.md` for current status.

## Getting started

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt   # created in Phase 0
cp .env.example .env              # then fill in API keys
```

## Running Claude Code on this project

```bash
cd "Support voice agent"
claude
```

First prompt to give it: *"Read CLAUDE.md and PROJECT_PLAN.md, then implement Phase 0. Stop when its checkpoint passes and update PROGRESS.md."*
